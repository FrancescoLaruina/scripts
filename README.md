# scripts
A collection of scripts with different goals:

- **dotdesktop** takes an executable path as input, creates a .desktop file and opens it for editing
- **install_font** takes the path of one or more fonts as input and installs them
- **svg2png_inkscape** calls inkscape to convert a svg file to png 
- **pdfunite_printer_friendly** a tiny python script to join PDF files leaving blank pages for easier printing
- **zip_rename.py** a utility to extract and rename files in a zip archive. Useful when the names of the files to be extracted is not unique.
